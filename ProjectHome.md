This is based on pyserial 2.2 from Sourceforge, with a win32-specific bugfix. This package can be used as a drop-in replacement for pyserial.

The only reason I put this patch here is that there does not seem to be any activity in the original Sourceforge project at the moment, and the bug report with a proposed patch has been sitting there for a while without getting any attention.
